### Understanding Registers:

The x86_64 architecture provides a set of general-purpose registers, each 64 bits wide. The registers are named as follows: `%rax`, `%rbx`, `%rcx`, `%rdx`, `%rsi`, `%rdi`, `%rbp`, `%rsp`, `%r8-%r15`.

Additionally, there are eight `64-bit` SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) registers: `%xmm0-%xmm7`, which can be used for floating numbers.
